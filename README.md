# pySweeper
 minesweeper clone for practice


v0.3:
	Reveals the number of bombs around where you are standing (and kills you if you stand on it).  Also fixed an error due
	to forgetting that -1 is a valid input for list indexing, which lead to phantom bombs.  Added an extra check to avoid that.
v0.2:
	calculates the number of bombs correctly according to a few tests.
	immediate todo for next version: allow user to click for bombs, and reveal the number of surrounding bombs.
	automatic revealing of 'zero squares' will be done in a future build.
v0.1: 
	places mines and shows the playing field
	immediate todo for the next version: calculate and show the number of bombs surrounding any spot that isn't a bomb
